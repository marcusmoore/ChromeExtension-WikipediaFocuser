#Wikipedia Focuser
Implementation of an idea I had this morning.  

##Why?
Every once in a while I end up with 17 browser tabs of Wikipedia articles when I started with just one. What happened? I most likely started middle-clicking interesting links as I read the first article and end up with way too many.  

##What?
So I made a Google Chrome extension to block all links within an article to help keep focused.  

##Doesn't That Already Exist?
Probably. Honestly, I didn't look it up and I wanted to see how easy it was to make a Chrome extension. (It's really easy).  

##How to use
From Google's documentation [here](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked):  

1.  Visit chrome://extensions in your browser (or open up the Chrome menu by clicking the icon to the far right of the Omnibox: The menu's icon is three horizontal bars.. and select Extensions under the Tools menu to get to the same place).
2.  Ensure that the Developer mode checkbox in the top right-hand corner is checked.  
3.  Click Load unpacked extensionâ€¦ to pop up a file-selection dialog.
4.  Navigate to the directory in which your extension files live, and select it.


##What's next?
I'm "tagging" this as v0.1 because I didn't put that much effort into it and I only tested it on 3 pages. So a list off the top of my head is:

* Keep Table of Content intact
* Switch to a button that turns the extension on a off when necessary
* Make a logo for button mentioned above
* Market it and sell it for $200
